Create a new extraction of type SAP Table Join. 

![tj-1](/img/content/tj-1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The following dialog opens:

![tj-2](/img/content/tj-2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Click to add an SAP table (or view). 

![tj-add-table](/img/content/tj-add-table.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

In the lookup dialog search for a Table. 

![tj-lookup-1](/img/content/tj-lookup-1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

In our example we search for the table MARA (General material data) and select it. 

![tj-lookup-2](/img/content/tj-lookup-2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The table MARA is now added to the designer. Let us now add the table MAKT for material descriptions.  

![tj-lookup-2a-mara](/img/content/tj-lookup-2a-mara.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Let us now search and select MAKT. 

![tj-lookup-3](/img/content/tj-lookup-3.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Both tables MARA and MAKT are now added.
