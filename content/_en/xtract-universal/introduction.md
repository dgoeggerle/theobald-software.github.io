Xtract Universal consists of two components, the Xtract Universal Designer and the Server (a lightweight Windows service). Both components can be installed and used on a single machine as well as in a client-server architecture on two machines. 

You need a valid license for Xtract Universal on the server instance only, since data extraction from SAP is performed there. 

At design time, you connect the Xtract Universal Designer with the Xtract Universal Server. Within the Designer, you create the actual extractions, set up the connection to SAP as well as any destination environment and perform various configuration tasks.
