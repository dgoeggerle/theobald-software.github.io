For the use of the Oracle Destination, an Oracle driver must be installed. 


The **Oracle Data Provider for .NET 4** (managed driver) must be installed. 

[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/downloads/index-090165.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/windows/downloads/index-090165.html)

**ATTENTION**: Only Oracle data provider version 4.122.1.0 (ODAC 12.2.0.1.0) is supported by Xtract Universal.

You should follow the instructions to install the driver. On a 64-bit system you should install the 64-bit version of the driver, on a 32-bit system the 32-bit driver version. <br>
As an alternative to the *managed driver* the complete ODAC or the complete Oracle DB Client can be installed. Please make sure to select the ODP.NET component.

*Important*: After the installation the Xtract Universal service must be restarted!
