In this section we describe our custom connector for Power BI. This connector will add an Xtract Universal data source to Power BI's list of data connectors. Xtract Universal extractions will be triggered from Power BI and extracted data will be directly loaded into Power BI for further processing.<br>

**This functionality is still beta**. Please contact us at *support@theobald-software.com* if you would like try out the beta version of this connector.
