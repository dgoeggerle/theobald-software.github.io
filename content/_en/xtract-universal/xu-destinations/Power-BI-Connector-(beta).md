In this section we describe our custom connector for Power BI. This connector will add an Xtract Universal data source to Power BIs list of data connectors. SAP extractions will be triggered from Power BI and extracted data will be directly loaded into Power BI.<br>

**This functionality is still beta**. Please contact us at info@theobald-software.com if you would like try out the beta version of this connector.
