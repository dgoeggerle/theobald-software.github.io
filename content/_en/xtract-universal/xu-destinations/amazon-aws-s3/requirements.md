You'll need:
- an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account.
- the "[Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)" of your AWS user at hand. These Access Keys consist of  "access key ID" and "secret access key".
- an S3 bucket, in which you can upload data.
- The user needs at least the following permissions on AWS: Read/Write and ListAllBuckets. Please grant these rights in the User Policy. You can limit these rights to certain buckets only.

**Note:**<br>
Xtract Universal uses so called [Multipart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) upload for uploading data to S3. Data extracted from SAP is uploaded to S3 not as one big chunk of data but in smaller parts. These parts are buffered on the S3 side. If the extraction is successful, those parts are assembled by S3 into one file. While the extraction is still running this file is not visible on S3.

In case the extraction fails, for example because of an exception in the Xtract Universal software, Xtract Universal will take care that the already uploaded parts will be deleted from S3. In case of an "uncontrolled" extraction failure, for example due to network issues, Xtract Universal won't be able to delete those uploaded parts from S3.

Because of this, it's recommended to change the settings on S3 in a way that will trigger the automatic deletion of unused multiparts, e.g. after a day. You will find this setting by selecting a bucket and opening the Management tab. Select "Lifecycle" and "Add lifecycle rule" and create a rule for deleting unused multiparts.
