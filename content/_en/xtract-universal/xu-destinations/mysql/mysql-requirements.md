Before using this destination the ADO.NET Driver for MySQL (Connector/NET) needs to be installed.

The driver is available from [here](https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/). Please download the latest stable driver version. 

At the first use of the MySQL destination, the destination details dialog pops up to select the required MySql.Data.dll.

`C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Connector Net 6.9.9\Assemblies\v4.0\MySql.Data.dll`

After selecting the file click on Save and Close.
