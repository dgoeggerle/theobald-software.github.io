The dynamic load of data from a web file is deactivated in Qlik Sense per default.  
On the Qlik Sense help site you can find how to activate it. Do a search for 'Disabling standard mode' or check the following [link](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/2.2/Subsystems/Hub/Content/LoadData/disable-standard-mode.htm). 

In Qlik Sense deactivate the Standard Mode in Qlik Management Console -> Engine Properties.<br> 
In Qlik Sense Desktop open the file C:\Users\{user}\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Settings.ini in a text editor. <br>Change StandardReload=1 to StandardReload=0. Save the file and restart Qlik Sense.

If you are getting a "Forbidde" error when executing a Qlik Sense report please consult this [help page](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/connectors/Subsystems/Web_Connectors_help/Content/Connectors_QWC/Install/troubleshooting_load.htm?l=DE-DE).
