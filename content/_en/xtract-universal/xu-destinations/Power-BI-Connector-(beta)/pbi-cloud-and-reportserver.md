### Requirements

These requirements are not specific to Xtract Universal. For using the Power BI service you will need a [Power BI account](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/landing/signin/).

<br>

Also, you need to [download](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/gateway/) the Power BI on-premises data gateway. If you are using our Power BI custom connector you need to [configure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-gateway-custom-connectors) the gateway to support custom data connectors.
<br>
The support for custom data connectors needs to be enabled in the on-premises data gateway **as well as** in the Power BI service.
