Table Name is the name of the table in the Microstrategy dataset, where the data extraction is loaded to. 
This would be the name of the Dataset too, if a new Dataset is created. 

**Dataset ID** <br>
Dataset ID of the Table.This will be automatically generated by the MSTR server and can be found in the log. 
The Dataset ID is set automatically for the default DropAndCreate Update Policy.
For other Update policies it can be set manually.

**Folder Name** <br>
Optional. Set the name of an existing folder under My Objects in Microstrategy. The Cube will be generated in the defined folder. 

**Update Policy** <br>
Describes, how data is written to MSTR.
**DropAndCreate** is the default value. Table will be dropped and created again. Data will be then inserted.
**Add**: add data to the existing table. Dataset ID is required.
**Update**: will update the metric values in the data set where there is already a matching key in the dataset; new records are ignored. 
**Upsert**: Upsert will update existing records and then add any new ones as well.
**Replace**: Table will be truncated. Data will be then inserted. Dataset ID is required.

**Attributes and metrics**

Attributes and metrics will be defined automatically based on the data types of the source object.

**Date Conversion** 

**Convert date strings** <br>
Converts SAP dates (YYYYMMDD, e.g. 19900101) into a formatted date value. In the destination the date field does not have a string data type but a date data type (YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 1990-01-01). 

**Convert invalid dates to** <br>
Every invalid value will be converted into this value. NULL is supported as value. 
You should set this value to be used in case of no convertible date values.  
During the conversion of invalid SAP dates the two specific cases 00000000 and 9999XXXX will be checked at first. 

**Convert 00000000 to** converts all SAP date 00000000 to this value.<br> 
**Convert 9999XXXX to** converts all SAP date 9999XXXX to this value.
