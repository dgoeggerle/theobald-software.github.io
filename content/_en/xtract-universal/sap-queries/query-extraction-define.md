Define a new Query Extraction with the BOARD Designer. The following screen pops up:

![SAPQuery-01](/img/content/SAPQuery-01.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Click the binocular button to open the search dialog. A query will be unique identified by the workspace, the user group and the query name. You can restrict your search using wildcards ( * ). Once you find the right query, click the *OK* button to transfer the query to the editor.

![SAPQuery-02](/img/content/SAPQuery-02.png){:class="img-responsive"} 

In the main Window you see the so-called *Select Options*. These are the selection criteria, you'd see if you start the query in the SAP GUI.

![SAPQuery-03](/img/content/SAPQuery-03.png){:class="img-responsive"}


You have to select a variant (see chapter [Apply Variants](./apply-variants)) or a value for the maximum number of rows (see chapter [Extraction Settings](./extraction-settings)).
