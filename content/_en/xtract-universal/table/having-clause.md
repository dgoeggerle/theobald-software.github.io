A HAVING Clause can be stored in the *HAVING Clause* tab and the result displayed with *Load live preview*. The aggregate functions from the column selection are only supported in the HAVING Clause and must be activated accordingly. <br> 

Note that if the field name is not unique, the table name must be listed in the HAVING Clause (for example, MAKT~MATNR). This can be the case, for example, with table joins.

With regard to syntax and formulas, the same rules apply as for the WHERE Clause.
