### How do I create a backup?
Just make a copy of all Alteryx workflows that use Xtract for Alteryx.
In addition make a copy of the folder that contains the SAP connections. It is depending on the Alteryx Settings and can be e.g. found under %AppData%\Theobald Software\Xtract for Alteryx (in our case C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Theobald Software\Xtract for Alteryx\Connections).
A backup is also recommended if you are updating the version of your Alteryx Desktop or Server. 
We recommend that you create a backup at regular intervals so that you can easily switch back to the previous version if necessary or problems occur.
Also note the product version that you are currently using so that you can switch back to the same version in the event of an error.
