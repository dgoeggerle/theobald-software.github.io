BW queries often have variables to create filter options. The variable dialog is accessed using the Edit Variables button. <br>
Depending on the variable type, individual values or a range (from/to) can be selected for the restriction. <br>
The buttons with the three dots to the right of the respective input field serve as input help and list all possible input values.<br>
Direct input is grayed out for variables with complex selection options. Here, the input must be made in a separate mask, which can be accessed via Edit. <br>
The logic of complex selection is based on the usual possibilities. <br>
The Sign specification defines whether the respective selection column is included or excluded. <br>
Option defines how the values are to be interpreted (e.g. "Equals", "Greater Than", etc...) <br>
