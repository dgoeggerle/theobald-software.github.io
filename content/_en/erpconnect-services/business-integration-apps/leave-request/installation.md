Note:

We do not deliver installer packages for SharePoint 2010. The required WSP package has to be installed manually via Management Shell. 

You can download the WSP package for SP2010 and the SAP transport request as a ZIP-file [here](https://cdn-files.theobald-software.com/help/ECS/Theobald.LeaveRequestSP2010.zip).  


**System requirements** 

ERPConnect Services must be installed on the SharePoint Server.
An ECS Service Application must be created, for more information refer to our [online help](../../ecs/configuration/creating-an-ecs-service-app).



**SAP Customizing**

Since the Business Integration Apps get use of the SAP customizing settings for leave requests and leave approvals some configurations have to be made on SAP side:

- Organizational management for building teams and assign managers for approval  
- Time quotas for quota deduction
- Customized absence types
- Service specific settings about absence requests, team calendar and working time accounts
- ESS user with appropriate authorization roles
- Linked ESS user to a personell number (maintained in Infotype 0105) 
- Functioning approval workflow

In principle many SAP standard settings can be used as customizing, e.g. in standard a functioning approval workflow should be available. The effort required to get the app running is therefore at a manageable level.  
 
**Installing the SAP transport** 

The SAP transport request must be installed in SAP. For more information about the installation of the transport request check our [Knowledgebase](https://my.theobald-software.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/68/0/how-to-import-an-sap-transport-request-with-the-transport-management-system-stms).

**Installation of the solution package using the installer**

Execute files Theobald.LeaveRequest.exe and Theobald.LeaveRequestManager.exe and follow the installation routine. 
The SharePoint WSP-packages will be automatically deployed to your SharePoint server and the features will be activated.
