The Business Integration App for **Leave Requests** enables employees within their familiar SharePoint environment to post leave requests such as vacation or flextime to their manager for approval. Approved requests are updated directly in the corresponding SAP infotype. Via a team calendar employees are able to get an overview about absences in their organizational unit. In addition, there is the possibility to look up absence quotas such as remaining leave in a leave summary screen. 
    
With a separate Business Integration App for **Leave Approval** managers can approve or reject requests which are stored in a personal worklist. There is also a team calendar available for managers.
