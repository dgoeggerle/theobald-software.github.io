With the BCS Connector which is part of ERPConnect Services you can easily create an external content type for SAP data without the need to write any code. You can publish the content type directly to the SharePoint BCS metadata store and create an external list with SAP data in SharePoint. The connectivity between the external list and the SAP system is enabled through ERPConnect Services and supports create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations on SAP data.
Nintex Workflow offers the standard workflow actions Query List, Create Item, Update Item and Delete Item that can be used on SharePoint external lists.
