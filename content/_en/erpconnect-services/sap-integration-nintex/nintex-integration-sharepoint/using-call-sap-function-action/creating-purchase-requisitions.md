In the solution example outlined here, a standard SharePoint list is used to capture procurement requests. Using Nintex Workflow, a request is then routed to an approver. If approved, a purchase requisition is created in SAP. This scenario was implemented with the *Call SAP Function Custom* Action for Nintex Workflow.
