*Advanced Options*

When using this function module for extraction it is possible

- to extract tables whose overall length of all columns to be extracted exceed 512 bytes
- to extract tables that contain at least one column of the type F (floating point) 
- to extract table TCURR which has various problems with meta data in the Data Dictionary     

For further information about the installation of function module Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE check the section SAP Customizing. 

*Row count (0 = unlimited)*: With this function the overall number of rows displayed can be limited to a certain number. In standard the number is not limited.
