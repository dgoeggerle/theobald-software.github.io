**Installing the solution with the installer**

The Theobald Software Nintex Workflow Custom Actions (Query XQL Action, Call SAP Function and Read SAP table) are delivered as a 
installer package together with ERPConnect Services installation. Prerequisite for the implementation of the Custom Actions is a Nintex Workflow Installation on your SharePoint server (supported Versions: 2010 and 2013). 

You find the installation file in the following folder: 
C:\Program Files\ERPConnect Services\ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.exe

Follow the installation routine and the solution will be automatically deployed to and activated on SharePoint.

If a previous version is already installed there are the two options *Repair* and *Remove*.

With *Repair* the installed solution will reinstalled/updated that means the prior solution will be retracted and removed and a current solution package will be installed. With *Remove* the solution will be completely deleted on the server.

With newer Nintex Workflow Versions (as of 3.1.4) it is necessary to activate the Custom Actions explicitly on the site collection level. On your site collection go to *Site Settings>Nintex Workflow> Manage Allowed Actions* and mark the checkboxes for the three Custom Actions in the *ERPConnect Services* category. Save your entries with *OK*. Only then the Custom Actions will be available in the Nintex Workflow designer.

Furthermore for reinstalling/updating the solution using *Repair* it is necessary to (re-)activate the web application for Nintex Workflow. Otherwise there might be problems with workflow publishing. Go to *Central Administration>Nintex Workflow Management>Web Application Activation*. The default web application should be pre selected. Click *activate*.

Installing the solution manually
            
For manual installation solution package *ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.wsp* that can be found in the installation folder and must be deployed and activated. 

Add the solution package using the SharePoint Management Shell:<br>
add-spsolution -LiteralPath "C:\Program Files\ERPConnect Services\ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.sp20XX.wsp"   

Uninstalling the solution manually

In case you reinstall the solution package you first have to retract and remove the outdated version. 

To retract the deployed solution go to Central Administration->System Settings->Manage farm solutions->ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.wsp and select Retract Solution. 

Tor remove the solution using the SharePoint Management Shell:<br>
remove-spsolution -identity "ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.sp20xx.wsp"

The custom actions are still available in the Nintex Actions administration. To completely remove them, run the following SharePoint Management Shell commands:<br> 
NWAdmin.exe -o RemoveAction -adapterType ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.ReadTableAdapter<br>
NWAdmin.exe -o RemoveAction -adapterType ERPConnectServices.NintexWorkflowActions.CallBAPIAdapter<br>
