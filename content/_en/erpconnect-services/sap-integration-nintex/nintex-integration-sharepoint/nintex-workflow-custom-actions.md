Besides the two integration options with Nintex Workflow of using web services that are created with the WS Designer or using external lists that are created with the BCS Connector (for examples see [Nintex Integarion Scenarios]()) Nintex Workflow can interact directly with SAP via so-called Custom Actions that are provided by Theobald Software.

By default Nintex Workflow provides a wide range of workflow actions for designing individual workflows. For specific requirements these workflow actions can be extended by individually programmed Custom Actions. In combination with ERPConnect Services Theobald Software has created the Custom Actions [Call SAP Function](./nintex-workflow-custom-actions/call-sap-function-action), [Read SAP table](./nintex-workflow-custom-actions/read-sap-table-action) and [Query XQL](./nintex-workflow-custom-actions/query-xql-action) that can be used independently from each other for integrating and processing SAP data in SharePoint. The solutions are delivered with ERPConnect Services and have to be installed separately (see [Installation](./nintex-workflow-custom-actions/installation) ).
