With the **Call SAP Function** workflow action you can call any remote-enabled function module or BAPI in SAP, directly from your Nintex Workflow solution and without any coding or complex configuration.
Using the **Call SAP Function** action you can enable scenarios that require read/write access to SAP. This custom workflow action is delivered as part of ERPConnect Services, together with the **Read SAP Table** action and the **Query XQL** action. 

To give a few examples, Theobald Software developed two integration scenarios that are described in detail in separate chapters:

1. Creating purchase requisitions
2. Travel Request and Travel Expenses
