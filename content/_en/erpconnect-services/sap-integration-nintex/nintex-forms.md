ERPConnect Services also supports direct SAP integration for Nintex Forms. In Nintex Forms the adding of JavaSript code is possible which enables the calling of the ECS Runtime JavaScript library and to use it for accessing SAP data.

With JavaScript knowledge it is thus possible to design solutions for a lot of potential use cases like the validation of SAP data or to load data into dropdown menus.   

Furthermore it is possible to integrate external content types created with the BCS Connector.
