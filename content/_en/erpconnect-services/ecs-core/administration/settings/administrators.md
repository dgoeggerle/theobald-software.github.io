To get access to the *Management Site* you have to be a registered Administrator. ECSCore administrator users can be added in the *Administrators* ribbon .



After the deployment of the *Management Site* you should change the password for the default administrator user *admin* as soon as possible. 


To create new administrator users click *Add user*.

Windows Users are in no way connected with ECSCore Management Site administrators.
