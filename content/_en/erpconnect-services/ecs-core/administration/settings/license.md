You need a valid software license to use ECSCore. On the *License* ribbon the currently installed license is shown. If you ordered a free 30-Day-trial-version of ECSCore the trial license is already installed.


If you buy the software you will get a new license key. Add the license key here after deleting the old trial license first.
