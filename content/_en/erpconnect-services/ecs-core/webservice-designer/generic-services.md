With the ECS Table Query action the call of any SAP table or view is possible. Drag & drop the action to the designer. You have the following configuration options:

**Table Name**<br>
Name of the SAP table or view to be retrieved.

**Row Skip**


**Row Count**<br>
Maximum numbers of rows to be extracted. 

**Where**<br>
WHERE Clause to be used on the table. The WHERE clause must comply with the SAP OpenSQL syntax. Additional information can be found [here](../../ecs/webservice-designer/soap-web-services/operation-with-sap-table/where-clause).

**Order By**<br>
You can define the sort criterion here, that is to say the table field that is used for sorting the result. 

**Custom Function**<br>
This field contains the name of the custom function module used for the table extraction. Supported is the use of custom function Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE which allows to extract large SAP tables or tables with certain restrictive characteristics.
