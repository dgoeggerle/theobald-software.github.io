The basics for creating SAP-integrated web services with the WebService Designer are described in detail in our OnlineHelp under [WebService Designer](../webservice-designer).  

However when creating web services for ECS Core there are some specifics you have to take into account which we discuss closer in the following chapters. 

To create a new web service for ECS Core click the *New* button in the *SharePoint Package* group. Select *ERPConnect Services* Core as target platform.

There is also a default web service and a OData specific web service selectable here. Unlike as for ERPConnect Services the default web service in ECSCore is in REST format. SOAP web services are not supported here.
