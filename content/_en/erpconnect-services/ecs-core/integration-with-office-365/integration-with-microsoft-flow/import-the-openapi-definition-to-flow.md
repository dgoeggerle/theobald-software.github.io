The *Definition* section gives an overview about the custom connector's actions, request properties (request URL, query parameters, etc.) and shape of the response. Furthermore the action is validated which helps to identify potential issues. Usually you don't have to change anything here. 
Under *Actions*  additional generic functions are listed if the *Add default actions to the definition* option was checked in the WebService DesignerS' OpenAPI settings.

Before you can test the connector you have to create it first. Only if all actions are validated sucessfully the creation will work.

In the Test section the custom connector's functionality can be tested. Therefore you have to create a connection first. Click on *New connection* and enter a valid API Key in the following form:<br> 
APIKEY [BASE64 encoded ECS Core API Key]

Example: APIKEY QjGCMTMxMjE0MTA3NDhCMUE5MUNZTzAyQjBDRTg1OUP=
