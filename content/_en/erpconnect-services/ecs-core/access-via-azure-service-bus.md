Azure Service Bus is a generic, cloud based messaging system to connect for example applications, services and devices - wherever they are.  

With the help of Azure Service Bus you can organize a secure environment decoupled from your business system with ECSCore and SAP. Azure Service Bus (Relay) connects to a dedicated server over TCP and controls an endpoint, which in turn is visible to clients and can be used to exchange data with the ECSCore/SAP.

To use this functionality a [Standard Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/pricing/details/service-bus/) level subscription is required which is not included in ECS Core.
