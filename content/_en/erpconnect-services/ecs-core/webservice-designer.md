It is possible to create web services with the WebService Designer and to deploy it on a ECSCore machine (locally installed or in the web).
The web services can then be called in any cloud application which is able to call up REST or OData web services (i.e. Nintex Workflow for Office 365, Microsoft Flow, Nintex Workflow Cloud,...).
