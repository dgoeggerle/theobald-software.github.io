As a first step in using the BCS Connector Designer, you will configure the connections to the SharePoint system and the SAP system. Launch the BCS Connector Designer from the *Start* menu, then *All Programs -> BCS Connector Designer*. 

Note the status bar at the bottom of the BCS Connector Designer window, indicating that the required connections have not been defined yet.
