Launch the BCS Connector Designer and start by defining the connections to your SharePoint system and your SAP system.

To configure the SharePoint connection, select the *Edit SharePoint* button from the ribbon.

To configure your SAP connection, select the ellipsis button next to *SAP R/3* Connection. 

The status bar at the bottom of your BCS Connector Designer window should indicate that both connections have been configured. For additional information see [Connection Settings](../../getting-started-with-the-bcs-connector/connection-setting).
