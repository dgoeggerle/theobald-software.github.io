Using the BCS Connector Designer, you can create an external list in SharePoint. The external list will enable the user to view, edit, create or delete a record in SAP, using the stereotyped CRUD methods that you defined in the previous steps.

Switch to the *External Lists* tab on the ribbon, and select the *New External List* button.

In the *New External List* dialog, specify a name for the external list and make sure that 'PRODUCTS' is selected as *Entity*.

Select the *Create* button to create the list. You should see a success message and when prompted to show the list in your browser select *Yes*.

Open the menu next to one of the list items. You are able to view an item, change an item or delete an item. By selecting the *List Tools â€“ Items* tab on the ribbon, you have access to the same operations or you can create a new item using the *New* button.
