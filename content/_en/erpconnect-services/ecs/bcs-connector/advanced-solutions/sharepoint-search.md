SharePoint Server 2010 enables you to search for data in external systems (such as SAP) using the Business Connectivity Services in SharePoint. You can define external content types that will be used by the SharePoint Server Search Service to index (crawl) the external data and to display the search results.

With the BCS Connector you can easily create external content types for searching of SAP data, which is outlined in the following example.

![BCS-Search-Results](/img/content/BCS-Search-Results.png){:class="img-responsive"}

{% include _content/table-of-contents.html parent=page.childidentifier collection=site.en %}
