This example illustrates how you can extend a BCS Connector solution in Visual Studio by adding a custom method to an existing entity model.

The scenario for this example is the release of a purchase order (PO) in SAP. With this solution, the SharePoint user will be able to navigate to a Purchase Order list, select an item and release it with a custom action.
