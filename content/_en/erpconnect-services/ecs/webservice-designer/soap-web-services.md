By default it is possible to create and deploy web services based on SOAP (**S**imple **O**bject **A**ccess **P**rotocol). SOAP is a common communication protocol that is used for data transfer between applications running on different operating systems. SOAP webservices are based on XML and use WDSL (Web Service Description Language) for generating transfer messages. On principle SOAP has virtually no restrictions for data transfer which makes it higly flexible and versatile.
