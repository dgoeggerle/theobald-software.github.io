You can specify an *ERPConnect Services* service application from your SharePoint server in the WebService Designer. At runtime an *ECS Service Application* is used to provide access to the SAP System. If no value is specified, the default *ECS Service Application* will be used.

Please refer to the ERPConnect Services Runtime help pages for how to configure an ERPConnect Services application in SharePoint.
