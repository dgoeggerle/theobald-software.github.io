The *WebService Designer* comes with a pre-built sample of a web service that returns customer data from an SAP ECC system.
The sample web service definition can be found in the catalog of the *WebService Designer*.
For this *Getting Started* scenario, we will use this pre-built sample.

Below the *Operations* window, select the *New* button.

The *New Operation Dialog* will be shown.
Select *Catalog* to browse the web service catalog.

In the *Catalog Dialog*, select the *CustomerWebService* as the web service, then select *GetCustomers* as operation.
Select *OK*.

Select *OK* in the *New Operation Dialog* to confirm your selection.

The GetCustomer operation will be displayed in the *ECS Web Service Designer* window.
The operation has a *START* item with the name of the operation.
Following the *START* item is an *EXECUTE FUNCTION* activity which calls the remote-enabled function module *SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET* in SAP.
We will more closely examine this activity in the next steps.
After the *EXECUTE FUNCTION* activity the web service process will terminate.
