To deploy a web service and to call an already deployed web service, you need a connection to the ECS Core Server. <br>
You set up the server connection in the menu item *Connections* under *Server...*. 
At the first call the dialog is not filled.

Details on the configuration of the server connection can be found in section [Webservice Authentication](../webservices/webservice_authentication)
