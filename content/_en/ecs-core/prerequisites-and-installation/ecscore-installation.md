The ECS Core components are then installed. After successful installation it is recommended to run the *ECS Core Deployment Manager* directly afterwards. The checkbox for the automatic start of the Deployment Manager is set by default. 

All details about the Deployment Manager are described in section [Deployment](./ecscore-deployment).
