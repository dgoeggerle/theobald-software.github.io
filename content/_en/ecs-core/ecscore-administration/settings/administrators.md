To gain access to the management site, you must be a registered administrator. ECS Core Administrators can be managed and added in the *Administrators* tab. 

After deploying the management site, you should add a new administrator or at least change the password for the default administrator *admin*. 

To create a new administrator click on *Add user*.

User name and password are freely selectable, there is no connection to Windows users. <br>

Important: The users added there not only serve as administrators for the management site, they are also used for the deployment of web services in the WebService Designer.
Details can be found in the section [WebService Designer](../webservices).
