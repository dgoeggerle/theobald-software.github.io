On the *Management Site* the configuration for ECS Core is done. 

By default, the *Management Site* can be found at http://localhost:8085. <br>
Afterwards you can save the website as a bookmark in your web browser.<br>
The management site can also be started via the IIS Manager. 

The initial user/password pair is admin/admin. It is best to change it directly after logging on to the management site for the first time. How to change the password is described in [Settings>Administrators](.\settings\administrators). 

The following services are available on the management site:

**[ECS Core Dashboard](./ecscore-dashboard)**

Here you get an overview of all contents of the management site. 

**[SAP Connections](./sapconnections)**

Here you create and manage the connections to SAP.

**[Secure Stores](./ecscore-secure-store)**

The settings for Secure Stores are managed here.

**[Web Services](./webservices)**

The Web Services can be managed here.

**[Settings](./settings)**

Here you can add licenses, define ECS core administrators, manage API keys, create a registration with an *Azure Relay* and perform certain system operations.
