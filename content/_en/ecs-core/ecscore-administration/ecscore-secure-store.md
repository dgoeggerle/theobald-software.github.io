Under *Secure Stores* a Secure Store can be added and managed for authentication. 
A Secure Store ensures that existing Windows users have seamless access to the SAP system with their own SAP user. <br>

Important: User mapping via a Secure Store only works if the application recognizes the Windows user identity.

Go to the *Secure Stores* menu and use *Add Secure Store* to add a new, freely namable Secure Store.

You can now use the *Credentials* tab to store SAP logon credentials for one or more Windows users. The SAP user name must be at least 5 characters long.

For *SAP Connections*, you can now select the new Secure Store for the authentication methods under *Use Secure Store*.
