One core functionality of ECS Core is the ability to create REST Web services for read or write access to SAP with the WebService Designer and deploy them to the ECS Core Server (locally or on the Web). The web services can then be used in any environment that allows to consume REST services (e.g. Nintex for Office 365, Microsoft Flow, Nintex Workflow Cloud,...).
A separate endpoint for the consumer application is provided.
