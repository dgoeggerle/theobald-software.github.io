Microsoft Flow allows the import of OpenAPI definitions as custom connectors. The WebService Designer supports the export of REST services in OpenAPI definitions. The chapter [here](../../webservices/openapi_definitions) describes the procedure in detail.  

To continue with the example, export the previously created web service for purchase requisition creation in an OpenAPI definition.
