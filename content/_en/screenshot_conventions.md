### About screenshot conventions
The following section contains information on creating consistent screenshots.
The main topics around creating screenshots are the following:
- Size, resolution & quality
- Highlighting (type, size, color)
- Position numbers

The recommended software for creating the screenshots is Greenshot. The following instructions will be based on the usage of Greenshot.

### Size, resolution & quality
For consistency purposes it is crucial that there are only several option sizes for the screenshots.
The size of the screenshot should be set within the .md-file using the attribute "width".

Size | Width in px | Example description
------------ | ------------- | ----------
XL | 1000 | Whole Screen; also applicable for architecture illustrations
L | 800 | Big windows
M | 650 | Medium windows
S | 450 | Smaller windows
XS | 250 | Parts of windows

#### XL

#### L

#### M

#### S

#### XS

Recommended file type for online content is .png. Using .jpeg is not forbidden, but remember that .jpeg-files are more compressed and this may lead to quality loss. In Greenshot .png is set by default. 
### Highlighting (type, size, color)
Generally use squares to highlight parts of a screenshot. Use Theobald red for any kind of highlighting.
### Position numbers
Use the default position numbers provided in Greenshot. Change the color to Theobald red.
