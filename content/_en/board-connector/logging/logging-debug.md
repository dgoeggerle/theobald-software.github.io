You also have the option to log debug information. If you want to log debug information you have to enter a valid directory path into the *Log Directory* field in the connection manager.

Please note that the logging usually should be activated by request of the support team. There are plenty of information that will be collected. This can decrease the capacity of your harddrives dramatically. Please note that the default logging is independent of the debug logging settings. The default logging will be accessed even if the trace directory entry in the connection manager is left blank.
