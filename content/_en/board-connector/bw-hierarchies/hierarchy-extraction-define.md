The BOARD Hierarchy component enables the extraction of hierarchies from an SAP BW/BI system.

In particular, clients who use the Open Hub Services to extract InfoObject Master Data, will find out that the *Open Hub Services* donâ€™t support Hierarchy Extractions.

Click *New* Button to define a hierarchy extraction. The search form appears with another click of the binocular button. By using wildcards (* as a placeholder), a hierarchy can be selected.

After making your selection, the component saves all relevant data needed for the extraction later on:
