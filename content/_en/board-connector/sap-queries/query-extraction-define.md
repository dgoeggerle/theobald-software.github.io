Define a new Query Extraction with the Xtract Universal Designer. The following screen pops up:

![Define-Query-Extraction-Data-Source](/img/content/Define-Query-Extraction-Data-Source.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Click the binocular button to open the search dialog. A query will be unique identified by the workspace, the user group and the query name. You can restrict your search using wildcards ( * ). Once you find the right query, click the *OK* button to transfer the query to the editor.

![Look-Up-Query](/img/content/Look-Up-Query.png){:class="img-responsive"}

In the main Window you see the so-called Select Options. These are the selection criteria, you'd see if you start the query in the SAP GUI.

![Define-Query-Extraction-Data-Source-Selected](/img/content/Define-Query-Extraction-Data-Source-Selected.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

You have to select a variant (see chapter [Apply Variants](./apply-variants)) or a value for the maximum number of rows (see chapter [Extraction Settings](./extraction-settings)).
