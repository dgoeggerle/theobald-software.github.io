**Security Tab** 

You find the *Security* tab under *Server -> Server Settings*. <br>
On the *Security* tab you can specify which computer has the right to execute extractions via HTTP.

**Allow HTTP access to everybody**

There are no limitations. Every machine is allowed to execute extractions.

**Restrict HTTP access to specific machines**

Only defined computers are allowed to execute extractions.

To define a restriction select *Restrict HTTP access to specific machines*  and click the *Add* button.

Now you can set the restrictions for single computers (IP-address) of for computers from a specified subnet or a special name pattern. To define a name pattern you can use regular expressions.
