The designer offers several functions for an extraction which we describe below. Simple and self explaining function will not be explained.

**File -> Import**

This command imports an extraction. To import an extraction named XtractFile select the file XtractFileConfig.xml. Optionally, you can select the file XtractFileMetadata.xml too.

**File -> Export**

This command exports an extraction.

**File -> Reset Preferences**

This command resets the settings of Log Viewer, last SAP Connection and Server URL.

**Extraction -> Abort**

This command aborts the execution of an extraction.

**Extraction -> Clear Buffer**

This command clears an extraction from the buffer. At the next execution of the extraction, data will be fetched from the SAP system.

**Extraction -> Filter**

This window provides extractionâ€™s search by name and keyword. You can use * as placeholder for zero or more characters. Regular expressions are also supported.


**Server -> Shared Connections**

This command manages the shared SAP connections.

Designer also provides buttons for direct call of selected functions. The functions are also accessible through keyboard shortcuts, which you can find in the menu items.
