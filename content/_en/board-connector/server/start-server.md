The Server is initially installed as a Windows Service and automatically started. But you can start the Server either as a console program or as a Windows service. In an environment in which multiple users access the same repository, you should run the Server as a Windows Service on a central server.

The service can be started and stopped via the Windows Services administration.

To uninstall the service use the command

*BCService.exe /u*

If you can not start the Server because the default port is reserved, please open the ServerConfig.xml file in the installation directory and set a suitable port.
