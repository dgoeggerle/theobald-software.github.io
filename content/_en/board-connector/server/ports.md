The server uses different ports for communication, for example to receive the extraction request via HTTP or to communicate with the designer.<br> 
Every port has a default value which could be changed. More information you will find in the chapter [Server Settings](./server-settings). 

If the servce did not start because the default port is blocked you have to open the XtractServerConfig.xml file in the folder config and define a valid port.

All ports used in our documentation are working on our system. It is possible that on your system different ports are vaild. If some examples do not work in case of different ports please contact your administrator and ask for the correct ports.
