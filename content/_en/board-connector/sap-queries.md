**Caution!** Please note that this chapter only describes the use of the ERPConnect Query Component. For all other basics please refer to [Step I: Define a Table Extraction](./getting-started-table/step1-define-table-extraction). For this chapter the knowledge about the basic usage of ERPConnect is assumed!

**Caution!** Query doesnâ€™t mean a BW Query but a "normal" Query that you create in the SAP transactions SQ02 and SQ01. If you want to use a BW Query as a data source, please refer to the chapter about [BW InfoCubes and BExQueries](./bw-infocubes-and-bex-queries).
