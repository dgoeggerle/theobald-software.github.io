The BOARD BW Cube data source component was developed to extract data from SAP BW InfoCubes and QueryCubes (also known as BEx Queries).

After the definition of a BW Cube data source the following screen pops up:

Click the binocular button to open up the search dialog as shown below.

You can also use wildcards ( * ) to search for InfoCubes and QueryCubes. Select the cube you want to work with and click *OK*.

**Caution!** A BW Query must have the attribute external access allowed to appear in this list. Please refer to SAP Query Designer documentation for further details.

After having chosen a cube, you will find all dimensions, key figures and dimension properties on the left-hand side of the editor. These parameters are presented hierarchically in a tree view.

To extract one or more of these cube elements, drag and drop them to the grid on the right-hand side. If you are choosing the property of a dimension that is not yet contained in the result set, the dimension will be added automatically as well.

If at least one measure has been selected, you can see the extraction output in the browser after clicking the *Run* button.

To select all the properties of a dimension or all key figures, right-click on the corrrespondent node and select the option *Select for Output*.
