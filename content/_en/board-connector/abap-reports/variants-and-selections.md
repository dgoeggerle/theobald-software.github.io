After having chosen a report, please assign a variant or a selection parameter. All elements of the selection screen can be found in the table called *Selection Screen*.

If you have a lot of selection parameters, please create a variant in SAP. This is easier to handle than many different single selection parameters.

Use the *Edit* link to fill in a selection. The dialog for editing a selection works like the one discussed in the chapter Entering [Select Options](../sap-queries/select-options-entering)
