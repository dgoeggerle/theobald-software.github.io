An extraction has two types of settings. The *Extraction Settings* include settings that affect only the respective extraction type, while the *General Settings* are the same for all extraction types and determine common settings. You can find information about *General Settings* in chapter [General Settings](../advanced-techniques/general-settings).

In the following chapter we explain Extraction Settings.

**Row limit**<br>
Maximum numbers of rows to be extracted. 0 is unlimited.

**Rows per package**<br>
The number of rows that are extracted with one single RFC call. If you want to download more than 20,000 data rows, please set this parameter to a value between 15,000 and 50,000 to avoid timeouts.

**None**<br>
The default RFC_READ_TABLE will be used to extract the table data. No custom function module is used.

**Compression**<br>
The compression function module Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_COMPRESSION is used to extract table data and avoid SAP restrictions.

**Use conversion routines**<br>
defines wether the conversion routines should be used.<br>
Typical examples are the language key (e.g. D in the database, but DE after conversion)
or the project number (e.g. T000012738GT in the database, but T/12738/GT after conversion).<br>
After conversion, the value is always displayed, as it would appear in the SAP GUI.<br>
This option is only supported with the function module Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_COMPRESSION. 

**Background extraction (obsolete)**<br>
Don't use this option. It is obsolete. Please use Compression option instead.<br>
The background function module Z_XTRACT_IS_TABLE_EX is used to extract table data in background and avoid SAP restrictions. 

**Function module**<br>
This field contains the name of the function module used for the data extraction.
