After the launch of the BOARD Designer, the designer must connect to the BOARD Server and the extraction repository. The address is in case of a local BOARD Server the localhost (as in the screenshot), or a different network address, depending on where the  BOARD Server is running. The default port may vary depending on the configuration. If the BOARD Server is running on another machine than the BOARD Designer be sure that the port is not disabled by your firewall. Click Connect to establish a connection with the server.

After connecting the server successfully, the buttons to create and configure extractions are enabled. The list shows all the extractions, which are already created on the server.<br>
Click *New* to define a new extraction and select the extraction type. In our case we want a table extraction.

Enter a unique name and click OK.

The next form shows the connection manager, with which you define the connection details. The form must be filled in as shown below. Please fill in the text boxes with the logon data (user name, client, language, password). If you need to log on to a single application host, fill in the fields *Host* and *System Number*. If you want log on by load-balancing the message server field, the *logon group* and *SID* must be filled in. If you do not know what these parameters in your SAP system environment are, please ask your SAP Basis Components department for help.<br> 
If everything is filled in correctly, try to establish a connection to SAP by clicking the *Test Connection* button.
