After the launch of the BOARD Designer, the designer must connect to the BOARD Server and the extraction repository. The address is in case of a local BOARD Server the localhost (as in the screenshot), or a different network address, depending on where the  BOARD Server is running. The default port may vary depending on the configuration. If the BOARD Server is running on another machine than the BOARD Designer be sure that the port is not disabled by your firewall. Click Connect to establish a connection with the server.

After connecting the server successfully, the buttons to create and configure extractions are enabled. The list shows all the extractions, which are already created on the server.<br>
