Every DeltaQ source has two outputs: one for the data (DeltaQDataOutput) and one for the protocol (DeltaQLogOutput). The best method is to write off the protocol in the data target as well. For Delta mechanisms in particular, a detailed protocol can be very helpful when troubleshooting. The data output correlates with the checkmarked columns (and the RequestID). The protocol output always has the same columns. The following screenshot shows the protocol in the Data Viewer:
