A demo license is automatically installed with the installation of Xtract IS. After having purchased Xtract IS, a regular license is provided. This license is bound to your company and a specific server name. For installing this license, please use the Xtract License Manager, XtractLicenseManager.exe. You can find the Xtract License Manager in the installation directory of Xtract IS.
