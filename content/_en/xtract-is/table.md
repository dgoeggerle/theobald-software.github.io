This chapter explains how to handle the Xtract IS Table component. The component contains two extraction types:

- **Table**: Enables mass data extraction directly from SAP tables and views.
- **Table Join**: Allows joining two or more SAP tables on the SAP side before extraction, a functionality previously only available in the separate *Xtract IS Table Join* component. 

The following source objects are supported by Xtract IS Table:

- pool tables
- transparent tables
- cluster tables
- views
- ABAP CDS views
