**Attention**: The join functionality described in this chapter will *not* work with the Xtract IS Enterprise license.

The Table component can be used to join several tables on the SAP side during extraction. <br>
Make sure that you have installed the Z_THEO_READ_TABLE function module on your SAP system. <br> 

After you have defined the first table, click on the *Add* button to add tables which you want to join. <br>


### Joins
In this tab you can edit the join conditions.<br> 
If you choose to have an existing join condition, click Edit to edit it or Delete to delete it. 
You can use the Add button to define a new join condition. <br> 


### Join Dialog
In the field *Left Table* define the name of the left tables. In the field *Right Table*, define the name of the right tables. In the *Join Type* field, define the join type: Inner or (Left) Outer. <br>

Use the *Add* button to add additional conditions. You select one SAP field each on the right and left side. To the right you will find a delete icon to delete an existing condition.
