To use the IDocSchemaGenerator, choose the IDoc type (and the enhancement if needed) and click the *Generate Now!* button. Save the XML file to your local hard disc. It can now be used with the method Idoc.LoadIdocSchema. An IDoc schema loaded via XML may have higher performance than it would be by loading loaded with *CreateIdoc* or *CreateEmptyIdoc*. (as shown in Chapter [XML-Support for IDoc programming](../receiving-and-sending-idocs/xml-support-for-idoc-programming))
