Structures are a special case of scalar parameters. In case of structures, an individual variable doesnâ€™t have to be assigned to the whole structure, but rather, to each element of the structure.

Please use the *Edit* link to open up an additional dialogue for assigning structure elements as shown in the screenshot. Analogous to purely scalar parameters applies also for structural elements: Imports may contain fixed values or variables. Of course the value fields in all cases can also be left blank, if the relevant parameter is not required.
