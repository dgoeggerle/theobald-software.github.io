After having chosen a cube, you will find all dimensions, measures and dimension properties on the left-hand side of the editor. These parameters are presented hierarchically in a tree view.

To extract one or more of these cube elements, drag and drop them to the grid on the right-hand side. If you are choosing the property of a dimension that is not yet contained in the result set, the dimension will be added automatically as well.

If at least one measure has been selected, the preview button can be clicked.
