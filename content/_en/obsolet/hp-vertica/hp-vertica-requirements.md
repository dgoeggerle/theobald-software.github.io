Before using this destination the ADO.NET Driver for HP Vertica needs to be installed.

The driver is available from [here](https://www.vertica.com/client-drivers/).

Once you have installed the driver you can select the *Vertica.Data.dll* from Xtract Universal's Destination Details dialog.
ATTENTION: To do so, you need to run Xtract Universal as administrator.

After selecting the file click on Save and Close.
