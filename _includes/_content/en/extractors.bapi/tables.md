Table parameters can be entered in and extracted from the function module / BAPI. Therefore, there are two types of behavior for table parameters: Input and Output.

The following options are possible:

**Value** column for input<br>
Select a value from the dropdown list to map it to the table. 
The input value is expected to have the same structure (number, data type and order of columns) as the SAP table.

**Output**<br>
Select the table in most left column to have it in the output. 

In our example the table ADDRESSDATA is selected for Output.
