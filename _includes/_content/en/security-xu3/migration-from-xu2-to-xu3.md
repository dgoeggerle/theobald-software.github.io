The migration from XU 2.x to XU 3.x can be performed automatically as follows:

During the installation process by checking the *Convert 2.x Files* checkbox. <br>
This calls the *Xtract Universal Configuration Converter*, which ensures that all extractions, source systems, destinations, server and user settings from XU 2.x are available in the new version. <br>

The start of the conversion process must be confirmed in the appearing command line window. <br>

If the converter is not executed automatically during installation, it can also be started manually from the installation directory. <br>
