## Install update on test environment
1. We strongly recommend: <br>
 1 to have a test environment with a valid license.  <br>
 2 that the test environment is a copy of the current production environment and <br>
 3 to make a backup of the current installation / extractions / settings etc before you install the update. A backup allows you to easily switch back to the previous version. If the environment is a virtual machine (VM), you can also make a copy of the VM. 


2. Please check our knowledge base for the version history and release notes before updates, see [Version History] (https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history). <br>
 1 If necessary, make all necessary preparations and changes, which are described in the Release Note / Version History. <br>
 2 You can also subscribe to our regular newsletter about version history changes and release notes. Just send an email to to sales@theobald-software.com.  

3. Install the current version of our product at first on the test environment and test the new version in depth. You should also test all your existing extractions. <br>
 1 In case of success, install the current version on the productive environment. <br>   
 2 In case of error contact support. You can also reinstall / reuse your backup until we provide a solution.
