## Installating an update (or a newer version) on a test environment
To install an newer software version over an existing version, please follow the steps below. 

1. We strongly recommend:  
 - The use of a test environment with a valid license and maintenance.   
 - Update of the software at least 1-2 times a year. 
 - The test environment is a copy of the current production environment and  
 - A backup of the current installation, settings and projects before the update. The backup allows you to easily switch back to the previous version. If the environment is a virtual machine (VM), you can also make a copy of the VM. 


2. Before updating, catefully check our [Version History](https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history) and release notes in our knowledgebase.   
 - Make any necessary preparations and changes as described in the Release Note / Version History, especially for major changes and high ([H]) update recommendation. 
 - You can also subscribe to our regular newsletter about changes in the version history and release notes. Just send an email to info@theobald-software.com.  

3. Install the current version of the software at first on the test environment and test the new version in depth. You should also test all your existing projects.  
 - In case of success, follow the steps to install the current version on the productive environment, see the corresponding section below.    
 - In case of error, contact our support: support@theobald-software.com. You can also reinstall / reuse your backup until we provide a solution.
