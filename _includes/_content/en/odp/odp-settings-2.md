**Show Subscriptions**<br/>
Click on Show Subscriptions to find information about the subscriber. That includes: 
- Subscriber Name: The Subscriber Name is based on the name of the machine, where the extraction is running on. This means that extractions on different machines (unless the names are the same) will have different Subscriber Names and deltas. The product name is also included in the subscription name. This might be helpfut for monitoring in SAP and to avoid some confusion.
- Last request timestamp
- Creation timestamp 
To delete the subscription click on the Delete icon on the right side. <br/><br/>
