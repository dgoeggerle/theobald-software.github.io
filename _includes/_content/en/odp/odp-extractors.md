ODP can be used to extract data from  Business Content DataSource (Extractors). 
Please note that most DataSource can easily get released for Operational Data Provisioning. 
The same applies to generic (custom) DataSources. ODP doesn’t change the implementation of application extractors, all the features and capabilities are the same. 

An extractor (in ERP or S/4 HANA) is an encapsulated business object, representing few source tables already in the source system  which brings business logic and it’s really a strength of the SAP source system because it’s very easy to get the business logic extracted. 

Extractors can provide the following data types:
- Transactional data
- Master data
- Text data
- Hierarchy data

There are standard delta extraction methods available for master data and transaction data.
